\section{Introduction}

The aim of this task was to create an image classification Machine Learning (ML) program that can distinguish between four different instruments - Piano, Snare, Trumpet, and Violin. Vimal et al. proposed a step-by-step solution on how to approach Machine Learning tasks. The first part involved collecting data to fill the dataset. Thereafter, feature extraction is performed on the data, and the subsequent Machine Learning Model is built. Finally, the model is trained and built. This method will be followed in this report to try and develop a functional model that can distinguish between the chosen instruments. 

The basic report outline includes conducting a literature review to engage with existing research and scholarly work relating to the task. This review would give insight into what methods of feature extraction and different ML models would be most applicable to instrument classification. The discussion then moved onto the methods of data collection, different types of feature extraction that were explored, the ML models used, and finally the tests and results. The conclusion summarised the findings of the task and states whether or not this model would perform well in the real world.
