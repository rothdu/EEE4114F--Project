As mentioned before, four instruments were selected to train the model. Sound clips were collected for the Snare, Trumpet, and Violin, from freesound.org and pixabay.com, which house massive libraries of royalty free music. It is very important to collect a variety of datasets that are unfiltered to resemble real-world applications. The piano sound files were collected by recording short songs played on a synthesiser. 

70 samples were collected for each instrument, where the data for each instrument is initially split into 80\% training and 20\% test data, with the training data further split into 80\% training and 20\% validation data. To aid the process of supervised learning, a .csv file of two columns was created. One column for the filename of the sound clip and the other for the name of the instrument.
