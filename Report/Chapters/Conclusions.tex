\section{Conclusions \label{ch:conclusions}}

The purpose of this task was to construct an ML model for instrument classification. The report began with a short introduction, followed by a literature review. Here, information was gathered on how to properly go about this task. The data was then collected from various sites, and different methods of feature extraction were performed to extract the relevant input features. The ML model creation was then explained. With enough information, the core objectives were then outlined, and investigated in testing. 

With the model retrained on all the training data, and evaluated on the test data to gain a concrete idea of the model's real-world performance. The final model accuracy was quoted at 74.2\%. Given that the model was trained on unfiltered data, this is rather impressive.
