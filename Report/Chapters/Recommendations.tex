\section{Future development \label{ch:recommendations}}

This model provided an analysis of the impact of various parameters including model depth and spectrogram windowing methods for classification of instruments. Limited hyperparameter tuning was performed on a version of the model using MFCCs, but all models examined could likely be improved through more extensive hyperparameter tuning.

The more complex model examined was seen to be more prone to overfitting to the training data. The conclusion in this investigation was that the simpler model was more appropriate for the given dataset, but overfitting could alternatively be improved through analysis of regularisation techniques.

The dataset used in this investigation included only a limited number of instruments and a small number of samples for each. A more comprehensive model would use substantially more data, and would likely need to sample many more instruments to be useful in the real world.
